"""
A two-dimensional gas-liquid multiphase flows using a front-tracking type
method. A set of Navier-Stokes equation is solved on a eulerian grid 
using a second order projection method. The fluid properties are advected 
by lagrangian marker points. The time marching is second order by using 
predictor-corrector method. The code can be used to simulate a bubble 
rising in a rectangular box.
